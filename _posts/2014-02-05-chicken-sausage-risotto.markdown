<h4>Story</h4>
  <div>
    <p>
	I got home last night, opened the fridge, and the options were limited. Chicken sausage stuck out as the main protein that we had on hand. That usually gets eaten with some Brussels' sprouts and pasta but we were out of Brussels' and two pots (one for pasta and one for some sort of sauce) seemed too daunting so I decided to go the Risotto route. We had some fresh basil that needed to be used, a tomato, some white wine that was about to turn into vinegar, and tons of garlic so I grabbed all of that and set to work. Risotto is a nice "one pan" vehicle when you have some ingredients that seem like they go together but you just need something to bind them. This version was very tasty.
