<h4>Story</b> </h4>
 <div>
	<p><img src="http://rotio.net/rotiofood/2014-06-11/market.jpg"/><br/>Yesterday, I went to check out a local farmer's market. It was a great experience where the people who grew/prepared/slaughtered the wares were actually standing there to explain to you exactly what you were getting and every step of the process. I was inspired to find some ingredients for our second sourdough pie. I found garlic shoots, which I had never worked with before, herbs de provence goat cheese, and white eggplant. I combined these with some bacon and chili oil to make a pretty tasty, if unconventional, sourdough pie.</p>

  <br /><h5>Directions:</h5>
	
    <div itemprop="recipeInstructions">
	  1. Remove dough from fridge at least one hour prior to preparing. Load pizza stone into oven/broiler and preheat to Broil or 550 F one hour before preparing.<br />
	  2. Flour peel or board with flour or corn meal.<br />
	  3. Roast eggplant slices with chili oil.<br />
	  4. Stretch dough slowly until it just begins to become translucent. <br />
	  5. Work quickly -- the less time on the board, the easier the pie will be to remove. Add eggplant, bacon, cheese, eggplant, and, finally, garlic shoots<br />
	  6. Transfer pie to stone and cook for 4-5 minutes or until crust is crisp and shoots are charred. <br />

<h4>Pairing - The Ogden</b> </h4>

	<br/>
	We paired this pie with The Ogden from Goose Island. The Ogden is a bold, sweet, malty Tripel with a fresh black currant, citrusy aroma of Brewers Gold and Citra hops. The sweetness of the malt is very nice to cut through the spicy garlic shoots and tangy goat cheese. The aromatic yet muted-spice hop combination pick up and amplify the chili oil but also provide freshness to the dish. Oh and the Ogden is 9% and lightly carbonated. It will give you a nice buzz.. and if not careful it will put you to bed. Enjoy as often as responsibly possible. It definitely just landed itself in my top 5...
